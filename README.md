# Generalized Wind Power Prediction Modelling 
•	Developed a robust data asset in R for predicting wind power output using machine learning algorithms.

•	Created an automated data ETL and engineering pipeline in R to gather and process raw data into metric such as hourly average and curtail for 11 target windfarms.

•	Implemented a benchmark model using Linear Regression as a foundation, achieving an MAPE of 11%.
